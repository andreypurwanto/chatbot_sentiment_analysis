## Homework Chatbot

please refer to homework_chatbot

task
- you can follow the example in chatbot_demo.ipynb, make sure to understand the code and improve some flow.

bonus point if :
- refactor code to better software design pattern
- use python script instead.
- added readable comment or flow explanation.

but it's okay if not because second homework takes more effort :)

need to submit : your script, loaded model (if too big then no need).

## Homework Sentiment analysis

please refer to homework_sentiment_analysis

task :
- create sentiment analysis modeling with airline_sentiment_clean_train.csv (text preprocess -> vectorize -> modeling), can use anything to preprocess, anything to vectorize, any ML model. *label on airline_sentiment column
- check airline_sentiment_clean_test.csv, predict with your model.
- try to find what some insight (minimal 1) in airline_sentiment_clean_test.csv with your sentiment analysis model (for example : most negative sentiment happens contains word delay and/or flight, need to focus on that).
